We are working on an easy way to download it. Our honest apologises for the inconvenience.


Currently, the only way to play the game is to download Godot 4.3.stable, download the game by clicking the green button -> zip, click the file with right mouse click -> unzip, create a new project in godot, search for the unzipped game, and create it.
